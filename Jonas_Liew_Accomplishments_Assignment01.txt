Jonas Liew Assignment 01 Accomplishments:

Functional Requirements

- Rigidbody2D ball that responds to gravity and interacts correctly with the playfield [2/2]
- Static colliders defining the playfield boundaries [2/2]
- Death zone with remove and respawn behaviour [2/2]
- Bumpers applying impulse with visible feedback [3/3]
- Trigger targets that react, disable, and reset [4/4]
- Configurable playfield behaviour [4/4]
- Scene organization and reuse [2/2]
- Submission requirements met (GitHub + Brightspace match, completed markers) [1/1] 

BONUS
- Freeze filed temporarily immobilizes ball for a configurable duration and resume cleanly [3/3]
- Portal games transfer reliably, prevents immediate re-triggering, and cleanly 
  maintains or intentionally modifies velocity [3/3]
